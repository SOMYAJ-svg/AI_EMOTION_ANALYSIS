Emotion & Behavior Analyzer
Overview
The Emotion & Behavior Analyzer is a Python-based application that utilizes DeepFace, MediaPipe, and Streamlit to analyze human emotions and behaviors from video input (either a live camera feed or uploaded video). The application detects emotions, hand gestures, eye direction, and head movements to provide a behavioral analysis report.

Features
Real-time Emotion Detection using DeepFace
Hand Gesture Analysis (Tense vs. Relaxed) using MediaPipe Hands
Eye Movement Tracking (Left, Right, Center) using MediaPipe Face Mesh
Head Movement Detection (Up, Down, Still)
Behavioral Analysis Report generated based on collected data
Multiple Modes:
Detective Mode: General emotion and behavior detection
Student Behavior Mode: Focuses on tracking attentiveness
Interview Mode: Analyzes emotions and body language during interviews
AI-Powered Behavior Insights using Google Gemini API
